My local hacks to make xls compile on nix.

In your xls checkout, link the shell.nix to your
directory (and do the usual, either load it directly
or have a direnv .envrc)

Apply the patches
for f in nix-*.patch ; do patch -p1 < $f ; done

The rules_python() pulls a dynamically linked binary,
so you need nix-ld to make it mostly work.

# Build with --keep_going as not everything is
# compiling yet.
bazel build -c opt ... --keep_going
