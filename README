My local hacks to make xls compile on nix.

In your xls checkout, link the shell.nix and nix/
to your directory (and the patch for convenience).

Since bazel downloads random non-hermetic dynamically
linked binaries (such as Python), requires

  programs.nix-ld.enable = true

to be set in your configuration.nix
